# Commons — Epic 3c (Live player roster)

A tiny multiplayer workshop game starter. This repo is meant to be **readable by non-technical people**: small increments, plain-language docs, and CSV-driven game content you can edit without touching React.

**Working agreement:** keep increments extremely small and code changes minimal. After each change, keep this README in sync with the current epic, and end with a suggested commit message (see [`.cursor/skills/step-readme-and-commit/SKILL.md`](.cursor/skills/step-readme-and-commit/SKILL.md)).

Living product plan: [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md).  
Firebase project setup: [`docs/FIREBASE.md`](docs/FIREBASE.md).  
Firestore rules (production): [`docs/FIRESTORE_RULES.md`](docs/FIRESTORE_RULES.md).

## How we got here

**Epic 0–2** — UI shell, teams/roles, CSV content  
**Epic 3a** — Firebase wiring + setup docs  
**Epic 3b** — create/join rooms (last hour list)  
**Epic 3c (current)** — live player roster + private hidden-role secrets

---

## User flow (this slice)

```
Main (rooms from last hour)
  ├─ Join room ──► Name + emoji + team ──► Stage (+ live roster)
  └─ Create room ──► Pick theme ──► Name + emoji + team ──► Stage (+ live roster)
```

On stage:

- **Players bubble** on the stage shows Red/Blue counts; tap it for the full live roster
- Your **hidden role** stays private (stored under `secrets/{yourUid}`)
- Scenario + starter proposal still come from CSV

---

## Firebase setup (required)

1. Follow [`docs/FIREBASE.md`](docs/FIREBASE.md)
2. **Republish rules** from [`docs/FIRESTORE_RULES.md`](docs/FIRESTORE_RULES.md) (players + secrets paths are new)
3. `cp .env.local.example .env.local` and paste web keys, then `npm run dev`

Without `.env.local`, the main screen shows a configuration error instead of rooms.

If Firestore is in **production mode**, publish rules from [`docs/FIRESTORE_RULES.md`](docs/FIRESTORE_RULES.md) or create/join will be denied.

Room helpers: [`lib/firebase/rooms.ts`](lib/firebase/rooms.ts), [`lib/firebase/players.ts`](lib/firebase/players.ts), [`lib/firebase/auth.ts`](lib/firebase/auth.ts).

## How to edit the CSVs

All workshop content lives in [`content/`](content/). You can open these in Excel, Google Sheets, or any text editor. **You do not need to change React code** to rewrite scenarios, roles, or starter proposals.

After you save a file:

1. Keep `npm run dev` running (or restart it if the server was stopped)
2. Refresh the browser
3. Join or create a room again so content reloads

If something is wrong (missing column, bad number, unknown category), the join screen shows a clear error message.

### Tips that avoid breakage

- Keep the **header row** exactly as-is (column names matter)
- If text contains commas, wrap it in double quotes: `"Like this, with a comma"`
- Do not delete required columns
- `scenario_id` values must match between `scenarios.csv` and `starter_proposals.csv`

---

### `content/scenarios.csv`

One row = one round.

| Column | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scenario_id` | Stable id (used by starter proposals) | `downtown_redevelopment` |
| `title` | Short title on the stage | `Downtown Redevelopment` |
| `problem` | The situation players discuss | long paragraph |
| `team_task` | What each team must propose | long paragraph |
| `discussion_seconds` | Suggested discussion length | `240` (= 4 minutes) |
| `round_order` | Play order (`1`, then `2`, …) | `1` |

Right now the app **always loads round_order 1** on stage. Round 2 is already in the file for later.

---

### `content/roles.csv`

One row = one hidden role. A player is randomly assigned one role when they enter.

| Column | Meaning | Allowed values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `role_id` | Stable id | e.g. `fiscal` |
| `role_name` | Shown on the private role card | e.g. `Fiscal Watchdog` |
| `description` | What the player is pushing for | free text |
| `target_category` | Which city total is checked | `jobs` `housing` `accessibility` `climate` `cost` |
| `comparison` | How that total is compared | `>` `>=` `<` `<=` `=` |
| `threshold` | Number to compare against | any number, often `0` or `2` |

**Scoring rule:** at end of game the player scores **1 point** if  
`final[target_category] comparison threshold` is true, else **0**.

Examples:

| Goal | comparison | threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jobs end above zero | `>` | `0` |
| Cost stays at 0 or below | `<=` | `0` |
| Cost stays under +2 | `<` | `2` |

Default Fiscal Watchdog uses `cost` + `<` + `2` so the role is still achievable when projects cost money.

---

### `content/starter_proposals.csv`

One row = one team’s starting draft for a scenario (Red or Blue).

| Column | Meaning | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scenario_id` | Must match a row in `scenarios.csv` | |
| `team` | `red` or `blue` | |
| `proposal_text` | Starting proposal wording | quote if it has commas |
| `jobs` `housing` `accessibility` `climate` `cost` | Suggested effects | whole numbers from **-2 to +2** |

These show as **read-only** on the stage in Epic 2. Players will edit/submit them in a later epic.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # then paste Firebase web keys
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Rooms require a configured `.env.local` plus Anonymous Auth and Firestore enabled.

---

## Explicitly not in this slice

- Editable team proposals (Epic 4)  
- Multiple themes  
- Advancing to Round 2 in the UI  
- Facilitator judging  
- Accounts or saved games  

---

## Suggested next increment

**Epic 4:** editable private team proposals (shared text + −2…+2 deltas + submit).
